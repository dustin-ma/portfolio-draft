I'm still learning!

I am a 4th year Computer Science student studying at Ryerson University.
I'm working to gain the skills and experience that can help me create the best visual experience for visitors. 
I am actively seeking an internship work in the Greater Toronto Area in order to learn and grow - reach out to me!
